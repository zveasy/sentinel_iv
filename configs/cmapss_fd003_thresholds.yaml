notes: >
  Auto-tuned p50=7.044 from engine=1 window=150-200; regression calibration only.
  FD003 exhibits lower sustained drift magnitude than FD002/FD004.
  Spike-guard added to ensure late-window escalation to FAIL in regression
  without reducing persistence guarantees. Not applied to other variants.
